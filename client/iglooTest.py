Goals:
* understand the "spy" register (probably the 200-bit one)
* try to write to a "read only" register and ensure that it didn't work
    * but first, read what's there so that in case you overwrite, you can undo your mistakes...
* understand the SERDES registers (see Microsemi documentation for meanings)
