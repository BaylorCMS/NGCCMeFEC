## NGCCM emulator Front End Controls and RPi Server

This server-client setup will allow users to easily send tests and log results of tests on the ngCCM emulator and attached QIE cards. The server should run on a Raspberry Pi, connected to the ngCCMe's i2c pins via GPIO. The client can run on any machine but must have network access to the Pi.
